# Nginx Reverse Proxying and Beyond

## Introduction

Here you'll find all the code (mostly Nginx configurations) for the
book **Nginx Reverse Proxying and Beyond.**

This is a book for sysadmin, developers and devops that are
confortable with LAMP or *BSD web stacks.

Each chapter has several exercises. Some solved that are worked
through in the book and some proposed. For the later we provide the  
here.

The repo is organized following the book structure, with directories
for each chapter.
